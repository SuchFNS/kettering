 * Programmed by: Colin Quinn
 * CS 203 Assignment 2 Brute Force Algorithm
 * 
 * Brute force algorithm for finding the closest
 * pair of X,Y coordinates. Starting at the first 
 * point, compare with all following points, then
 * start again at 2nd point and continue until all
 * combinations of points have been calculated while
 * keeping track of the minimum distance and which
 * 2 points have the minimum distance. 
 * Output the run time, which 2 points, and the distance.
