Chapter 3.1-3.3

3.1
Micrometer
	- 1/1000th of a millimeter, the common unit for professional microscopes
Cell
	- the basic unit of life
Magnification
	- ratio between observed size and actual size
Resolution
	- ability to distinguish between 2 adjacent points
Compound Light Microscope
	- a set of glass lenses and light rays passing through to magnify
Transmission Electron Microscope
	- uses a stream of electrons to produce a magnified image
Scanning Electron Microscope
	- 3dimensional view of the surface of an object

All living things are made up of cells as it is the basic unit of life.
Microscope technology is the reason that we are able to study cells to this detail.

3.2
Prokaryotic Cells
	- cell that lacks a membrane-bound nucleus and organelles
Eukaryotic Cells
	- cell that has a membrane-bound nucleus and membranous organelles
Plasma Membrane
	- membrane surrounding the cytoplasm that consists of a phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins
Selectively Permeable
	- having degrees of permeability
Cytoplasm
	- contents of a cell between the nucleus and the plasma membrane that contains the organelles
Organelles
	- small membranous structure in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells having a specific structure/function

The plasma membrane forms the outer membrane of the cell to regulate what enters/exits the cell.
Nucleus: through invagination of the plasma membrane
Mitochondria and chloroplast: by engulfing the prokaryotic cells

3.3
Fluid-mosaic Model
	- model for the plasma membrane based on the changing location and pattern of protein molecules
Diffusion
	- movement of molecules or ions from a region of higher to lower concentration
Osmosis
	- diffusion of water from an area of high to low concentration through a selectively permeable membrane
Facilitated Transport
	- use of a plasma membrane carrier to move a substance in/out of a cell from high to low concentration
Active Trasnport
	- movement of a molecule across a plasm membrane from an area of lower to higher concentration
Sodium-Potassium Pump
	- carrier protein in the plasma membrane that moves sodium ions out and potassium ions in the cell
