Process:
Replication: 	DNA -> DNA 	
	Enzymes + Definitions:
		- Helicase: unwinds DNA
		- Primase: lays down RNA primer
		- DNA Polymerase III: main synthesis enzyme
		- Ligase: fills gaps in DNA
	Initiated / Terminated:
		- 

Transcription:	DNA -> RNA
	Enzymes + Definitions:
		- RNA polymerase: uses 1 strand of DNA as a template
	Initiated / Terminated:
		- Stops when the secondary structures form in the mRNA preventing from more reading.

Translation:	mRNA -> protein		
	Enzymes + Definitions:
		- Ribosome: attach to mRNA to read the triplet code for base-pairing.
	
	
Notes:
	- 5' and 3' refer to strand polarity.
	- mRNA is transcribed 3' to 5'
