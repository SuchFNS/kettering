Chapter 2:
	- transitional metals have multiple oxidation states
	- metalloids have both metal and nonmetallic properties
		- metals tend to donate electrons
	
	- atomic number is # of protons
	- # of neutrons is protons - weight
	- the strongest bonds are covalent
	- water: 
		- a polar molecule
		- interact via an ideal hydrogen bonding arrangement
		- water is cohesive
		- the temperature of liquid water rises and falls slowly
		- water is the universal solvent for everything hydrophilic
		
	- Buffers:
		- buffers maintain pH within a narrow range
		- essential for biological reactions
		- a buffer consists of a weak acid and its conjugate base
		- blood is a buffer because it is made of bicarbonate ion and hydrogen ion
			- water + CO2 <=> carbonic acid <=> bicarbonate ion + hydrogen ion
