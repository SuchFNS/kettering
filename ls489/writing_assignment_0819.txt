Hollander's definition tends to be more focused on a far more interpersonal definition of ethics. 
This is to say that everything in life is bidirectional and one thing impacts all parties involved.
Something that often gets overlooked in ethics and related theories is the duality in interactions, where both parties have their own perspectives.
I tend to side more with Hollander as keeping these things in mind enables a more practical definition of ethics. 
Someone that is ethical in Hollander's definition fits a tangible role model type of idea.
This is to say that someone can genuinely be fully ethical following this definition, as it allows for us to take multiple things into consideration.
Adding personality into ethics allows for a more genuine connection between those involved and with the interpersonal and intrapersonal.
