# Kettering
School stuff

Things are a mess here mostly due to it being a large culmination of stuff from many sources. Mostly all of my work is here, some things are on Google Drive or are files too large for GitHub. Some work shown are group projects while others are my own work. This should be clear based on comments or header at top of each file.
