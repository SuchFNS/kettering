Network Forensics Notes

What is Computer Forensics?
	- CIA Triad
		- Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
	
	- Confidentiality:
		- Encryption
	- Integrity:
		- has not been altered in an unauthorized way
		- uses backups, checksums, hashing, MAC and HMAC
	- Availability:
		- computational redundancies, like RAID and load balancers, backups
	- In addition:
		- authentication, authorization, non-repudiation
	
Goals of Computer Forensics:
	- forensics is relating to the use of scientific knowledge or methods in solving crimes
	- acquire data even if the original owner does not want to leak that data
		- breach the security goal of confidentiality
	
	- 2 main elements:
		- Process:
			- how to acquire, handle and analyze evidence
			- what precautions to take
			- difference between evidence being admissible
		- Technical Knowledge:
			- deep understanding of the specific technology you need to extract the information
				- how is data stored at the binary level
